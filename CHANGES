Version 1.0.1
    This version differs significantly from the canonical unixorn Luggage version.
    It has been modified to use JITSQ (Just In TIme Shell Quoting) and will behave
    differently when using variables and file names that have spaces in their names.
    The canonical version required backslashes to escape characters at the time they
    were declared. When compiled with this version, Makefiles that were using
    backslashes to escape characters will have those backslashes now appear as
    litteral characters. As of 2011-07-08 these changes have only been tested on a
    limited number of Makefiles.
    
    Makefiles can now be named whatever you want and call other Makefiles in
    another folder.
    
    Metapackage (.mpkg) support added. This is very primitive and uses the
    deprecated format for simplicity. Subpackages are assumed to be in
    sub-folders below the directory with the mpkg Makefile.
